1. things we can see and we cant see 

if the kid break other people's window, the person will by s new window, the window factory will create many positios for worker, the workers will have money to buy other things, and the factory which is make these things will provide more poostions for workers ... ... so, the wealth of the whole scoiety will increase.

earthquack, taiphoon, ... seveare diasters will lead to the society wealth increase.
see Germany and Janpan had a increasingly development in economy after the huge loss in world war two. so it is neccessary to a country to have a big attack so that it could have a rapaidly increse.

Its ture for germany and japan. and the order of the history flow is that worldwar2 happened first and then their economy flies. but should we give a bomb to any other countriees who wants to have the economy and wealth increase like japan?

if the elders do not get their retirement, the young man will not find a job? 
if the machine is amarter than people, ppl can not get a pay from work?

NO

it is easy to judge the things that we can see in our life. but things that we can only see through our imagination and logistic thinking should be also important.

we can not ay that we should give any other countries a bomb to let them increase their economy. young people will adapt to a new type of job that maybe do not be created in new fields currently. smarter machine replace human and people will use their intellengece to make more profit to our society. all we need is our imagination and logistic prediction because all the method do not exsit right now and will be created in the future.

the imagination or the things we can not see right now are not all the right but all the important to be thinked about.
